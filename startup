	Attempt to recreate Top-Level coroutines
	Because the old program doesn't work (for me atleast)

	UPDATE: This is Lua 5.2+ compatible now

	Credits to:
	-Nevercast (for the old script, of course)
	-Piorjade (kappa)

	Have fun with this :)

	Nevercast's code: http://pastebin.com/2SQAzrWi

	The problem was the way he searched for shell. I already fixed it ones but Lua 5.2+ won't have getfenv()
	anymore and that's why I give a even smaller version of it

	And thanks (again) to Nevercast for this awesome idea :)
